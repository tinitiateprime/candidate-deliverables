# Introduction About yourself
* Years of experience
* Working models:
    * Offshore / onshore model
    * Global teams
    * Agile scrum projects

# Technical Discussion
* Core language interview questions and answers
* Object oriented programming questions and answers
* Design patterns
* Data Structures
* Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)
* Speaking techno-business
    * Talk of libraries used in specific areas of the project
    * For example, used DB connection pooling to handle multiple DB sessions
    * How are handling old logfiles, old data in databases
    * How are you adding new functionality
    * Removing old code, that is no longer used
    * Upgrading code to handle different data sources and targets
* Setting the stage before technical questions
    * your talking points must drive around concepts that you are well versed in or good at
    * try to drive the conversation on your terms
    * For example, if you are strong in CI/CD stress on those points during storyboard phase
* Testing (After Code Development)
    * Unit Testing Done by Developer (you)
    * Code testing by Testing team with various test cases (Different Inputs to your code)
    * Code testing by Testing team with various edge cases (Special Inputs cases to your code)
    * Integration testing, by Testing team (Your code and your team members code)
    * Code Defects / Bugs (tickets) [Tracked in JIRA / Bug Tracking software]
* Deployment
    * I will Dockerize the application
    * I will Check code into GIT and Version it in a Branch
    * Give the GIT branch (version of code) to Production support / DevOps team for deployment
    * I will do Post deployment validation
* Difficult scenarios
    * Handled large data volumes, using threading
    * Handled datetime with time zone
    * Worked with large volume multiple data formats (CSVs, DB Tables) as inputs for my application.
    * Handled code and requirement changes in short notice
## Data
* Data flow discussion
    * Data sources and targets
    * Types of sources / targets DB tables, Files (csv, xml, json, parquet, Avro), webservices, emails, notifications.
    * Process of receiving data from upstream and handing off data to downstream systems.
    * Nature of the data Transactional data, Master data
    * Data granularity (detailed, summaries, needs validation, pre-validated, requires filtering)
    * Single row multiple rows, full data sets, full updates, partial updates
    * Data frequency On-demand, Time bound (daily, hourly, real time)
    * Handling Metadata (folder names, server names, constants)
* Data Volumes
    * 100 MB to 1 GB of data every day, depending on application need
